    Alice was beginning to get <em>very tired</em> of sitting by her
    sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she
    had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
    pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,”
    thought Alice “without pictures or conversation?”
